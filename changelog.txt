Version 2.4 by WalkedBy (2021/10/10)
* ton of excessive unnecessary computations for Candy AI, makes 1.0 version unusable and blocks in game rewind
* buggy road building (bridges everywhere) which really should be optional
* AI/map car uncontrollable increase was possible because amount of cars was increasing lineary with city sizes
* candy cars are not updated with time, 1820 cars will stay all game up to 2100 and will block city traffic
* AI/map car overflow is prevented by using square root of population instead of linear steady grow
* some questionable calls removed from AI main loop to yearly/monthly/daily schedule
* AI will not try to build depots all game, only once
* all road building anyway not working and disabled, less safe part of script better be optional
* a bit more safety with small clean-ups and unnecessary while's replaced with for's
* numbers are adjusted for huge maps, i.e. slightly less density of cars per city
* added garbage truck (classic) other type
* (reupload 2.3) bugfix which prevented obsolete cars from updating without game save/load, should work fluently now in server mode

Version 1 (2020/07/12)
* initial release
